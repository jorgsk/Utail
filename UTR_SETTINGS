[DATASETS]
# Provide paths to the RNA-seq read files. The files must be either gem-files,
# zipped gem-files, bed-files, or zipped bedfiles. The extensions must thus be
# either of: .map.gz, .gem.map.gz, .bed, or .bed.gz.
# Avoid spaces and punctuation marks (.) in the filenames to aviod problems.
#
# You can use directory-shortcuts. Multiple files for one dataset are separated
# by ':'. Example:
# mydir = /myfolder/myreads
# Dset1 = %(mydir)s/subdir1/gem_mapped_reads1.gem.map.gz:%(mydir)s/subdir1/gem_mapped_reads1.gem.map.gz:%(mydir)s/subdir2/other_gem_mapped_reads.gem.map.gz
#
# All the files in one dataset will be merged, and each dataset will have one
# output file. For example, if you have 2 technical replicates lane1.gem.map
# and lane2.gem.map (two lanes in the sequences), you could define three
# datsets:
#
# lane1_alone = %(mydir)s/lane1.gem.map
# lane2_alone = %(mydir)s/lane2.gem.map
# both_lanes = %(mydir)s/lane1.gem.map:%(mydir)s/lane2.gem.map
#
# This way you can examine the output of each lane individually and also their
# merger for more statistical power.
#

[ANNOTATION]
# Put annotation_path = false if you don't want to use an annotation.
# Supported annotation formats: GENCODE, ENSEMBL
# If you want a stranded analysis, use 'stranded = true'. Use this if you
# supply genomic regions where you know that the strands of the genomic regions
# are factual. Use 'stranded = false' if you're just investigting general
# 'exonic' regions for example. If you supply both regional bedfiles and an
# annotation, the bedfiles will take presedence.

# annotation_path = false
# annotation_path = /users/rg/jskancke/phdproject/3UTR/gencode7/gencode7_annotation.gtf
annotation_path = /home/jorgsk/phdproject/3UTR/gencode7/gencode7_annotation.gtf
annotation_format = GENCODE
# annotation_format = ENSEMBL

# annotated_polyA_files = /users/rg/jskancke/phdproject/3UTR/the_project/source_bedfiles/polyAdb_gencode_merged.bed
annotated_polyA_files = /home/jorgsk/phdproject/3UTR/the_project/source_bedfiles/polyAdb_gencode_merged.bed

[RESTRICT_READS]
# Set RESTRICT_READS to the number of reads to grab from the datasets. This
# option is primarily for debugging purposes.
restrict_reads = false
# restrict_reads = 500000

[CHROMOSOME1]
# only_chr1 = true:
# run the whole simulation only with chromosome 1. This is for making
# speed-runs of the program. The first time this setting is used, the
# chromosome 1 entries from the annotation file above will be filtered out to a
# separate file.
#
only_chr1 = false
# run with all chromosomes
# only_chr1 = true

[GET_LENGTH]
# length = true
length = false
# if you don't care about the length of the 3UTRs, but only want their poly(A)
# sites, set 'length = false'. If you do this, you must have polya = true,
# otherwise Utail will do very little indeed ...

[POLYA_READS]
# NOTE: leve out the suffix of the index file!!
# gem_mapper_index = /users/rg/atanzer/DATA/GEM_indices/Genomes/H.sapiens.genome.hg19.main
gem_mapper_index = /home/jorgsk/phdproject/3UTR/mapping_files/gem/H.sapiens.genome.hg19.main

[CPU_CORES]
# Set how many cores you wish to use. default uses system_max minus 1. For
# example, with two processors that have two cores each, default is 4-1 = 3.
max_cores = 4
# max_cores = default
