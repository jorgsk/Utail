0) The tool in one sentence:

	"Uses RNA-seq data to characterize transcript 3UTRs in terms of expression
	level, length, and polyadenylation usage."


1) Who is interested in this tool?

	* Those who want to study alternative polyadenylation with RNA-seq
	* Those who want to study 3UTR-length variation between RNA-seq datasets
	* Those who want to find novel polyadenylation sites in RNA-seq data


2.1) Input -- required:

	* RNA-seq reads -- raw or in .bed format
	* GENCODE annotation OR self-annotated 3UTR in .bed format 
	* Human genome in .fasta format


2.2) Input -- optional	

	* Poly(A) reads (can be gathered from raw RNA-seq reads)


3.1) Output -- without poly(A) reads

	* 3UTR end for each gene -- based on the epsilon parameter
	* Length of 3UTR relative to the annotation.
	* Coverage and RPKM for whole 3UTR
	* Coverage before and after 3UTR end

3.2) Extra output -- with poly(A) reads

	* Putative TTS sites in 3UTR 
		*  Evidence: poly(A) reads; coverage change around TTS site
	* If annotation is provided, highlight poly(A) sites not found in the annotation


4) Comparative methods -- using the output to say something interesting

	* Output the genes that have different 3UTR expression
	* Output list of genes that have different 3UTR lengths
	* Output list of genes that use different poly(A) sites.

5) Case study: Gingeras dataset. 

	* Present the output in 4)
	* Do genes with different 3UTR length in different compartments have smth
	* in common?
	* What miRNA binding sites are lost/found with different 3UTR length?
	* what more?
