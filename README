An outline of the project from March until the end in July.

Narrow down the focus. Set clear goals.

First, an outline of the tool as it stands today.


0) The tool in one sentence:

	"Uses RNA-seq data to characterize transcript 3UTRs in terms of expression
	level, length, and polyadenylation usage."


1) Who is interested in this tool?

	* Those who want to study alternative polyadenylation with RNA-seq
	* Those who want to study 3UTR-length variation between RNA-seq datasets
	* Those who want to find novel polyadenylation sites in RNA-seq data


2.1) Input -- required:

	* RNA-seq reads -- raw or in .bed format
	* GENCODE annotation OR self-annotated 3UTR in .bed format 
	* Human genome in .fasta format


2.2) Input -- optional	

	* Poly(A) reads (can be gathered from raw RNA-seq reads)


3.1) Output -- without poly(A) reads

	* 3UTR end for each gene -- based on the epsilon parameter
	* Length of 3UTR relative to the annotation.
	* Coverage and RPKM for whole 3UTR
	* Coverage before and after 3UTR end

3.2) Extra output -- with poly(A) reads

	* Putative TTS sites in 3UTR 
		*  Evidence: poly(A) reads; coverage change around TTS site
	* If annotation is provided, highlight poly(A) sites not found in the annotation


4) Comparative methods -- using the output to say something interesting

	* Output the genes that have different 3UTR expression
	* Output list of genes that have different 3UTR lengths
	* Output list of genes that use different poly(A) sites.


5) Case study: Gingeras dataset. 

	* Present the output in 4)
	* Do genes with different 3UTR length in different compartments have smth
	* in common?
	* What miRNA binding sites are lost/found with different 3UTR length?
	* what more?


6) Timeline

	* March/mid-April -> complete the code and streamline the command-line interface
	* mid-April/mid-May -> case study Gingeras see 5)
	* late-May/June -> document first the case study; then the program itself
	* July -> submission?


7) Publication general outline:

	1) A tool for analyzing 3UTRs with RNA-seq
	2) A case study using the Gingeras data


Unresolved issues: 

1) Paired end vs. non-paired. Should we use the information?
	Status: I'm using it! Now I just have to 'not use' not paired end!
	Solution: demand paired?

2) Detection of novel poly(A) sites.
	Solution: make bedfiles for the unambiguous parts of the genome
