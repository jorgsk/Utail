This file details the requirements and instructions for Utail -- a program that
obtains poly(A) site information from RNA-seq data.

Utail has the following requirements (version in parenthesis):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run Utail, simply type "python utail.py". Before running Utail, however, it
is necessary to correctly configure the file UTR_SETTINGS. See UTR_SETTINGS for
examples and further explanation.

After running Utail, the output will appear in the folder 'output'. This output
can now be used to generate several figures that illustrate the data. To
generate the figures, run the file 'results.py'. To decide which figure to run,
you must edit the 'results.py' source code by commenting or un-commenting the
function calls.
