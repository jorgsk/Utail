[DATASETS]
# Provide paths to the RNA-seq read files. The files must be either gem-files,
# zipped gem-files, bed-files, or zipped bedfiles. The extensions must thus be
# either of: .map.gz, .gem.map.gz, .bed, or .bed.gz.
# Avoid spaces and punctuation marks (.) in the filenames to aviod problems.

[ANNOTATION]
# Put annotation_path = false if you don't want to use an annotation.
# Supported annotation formats: GENCODE, ENSEMBL
# If you want a stranded analysis, use 'stranded = true'. Use this if you
# supply genomic regions where you know that the strands of the genomic regions
# are factual. Use 'stranded = false' if you're just investigting general
# 'exonic' regions for example. If you supply both regional bedfiles and an
# annotation, the bedfiles will take presedence.
