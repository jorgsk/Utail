Introduction to Utail
=====================
This document gives the biological background for why this Utail was made, it
lists the dependencies of the Utail, and it shows two different ways of using
the Utail -- with or without an annotation.

This document is autogenerated by Sphinx and a bit difficult to navigate. To

upper left corner.


On 3UTRs and RNA-seq
====================
The 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs are known to contain sequence and
structural motifs that regulate stability, localization and translation of the
mRNAs. By varying the length of 3'UTRs, the cell can thus include or exclude
regulatory regions.

High-throughput RNA-sequencing gives a high-resolution coverage of the
transcriptome. Utail uses RNA-seq reads to cover the 3UTRs of genes. It
outputs the length of the 3UTR as well as evidence of polyadenylation events if
possible.

We made Utail because we wanted a to characterize the 3UTR of transcripts from
any kind of RNA-seq experiment.
