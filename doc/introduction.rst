Introduction to Utail
=====================
This document gives the biological background for why this Utail was made, it
lists the dependencies of the Utail, and it shows two different ways of using
the Utail -- with or without an annotation.

This document is autogenerated by Sphinx and a bit difficult to navigate. To

On 3UTRs and RNA-seq
====================
The 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs are known to contain sequence and
structural motifs that regulate stability, localization and translation of the
mRNAs. By varying the length of 3'UTRs, the cell can thus include or exclude
regulatory regions.

High-throughput RNA-sequencing gives a high-resolution coverage of the
transcriptome. Utail uses RNA-seq reads to cover the 3UTRs of genes. It
outputs the length of the 3UTR as well as evidence of polyadenylation events if
possible.

We made Utail because we wanted a to characterize the 3UTR of transcripts from
any kind of RNA-seq experiment.


Getting 3UTRs from annotation
=============================
When providing an annotation, UTail tries to construct a set of 3UTRs for each
gene. A given gene may have 1 or several annotated 3UTRs. The selection of
3UTRs is strict -- if a 3UTR overlaps other genomic features, it is discarded.
This will remove the number of false positives in the RNA-seq data.

Specifically, UTail first clusters the 3UTRs for each gene. A gene may be
annotated with several UTRs that start at the same genomic coordinate, but have
different lengths, as a result of differential usage of polyadenylation sites.
From a given cluster, only the longest 3UTR is selected. The rest are
discarded. If that longest 3UTR overlaps another genomic feature (another exon
of some sort, such as the 5' or 3' of the next gene), it is also discarded.

3UTRs with multiple exons are supported. However, often these 3UTRs overlap
other genomic regions are are discarded by the program. Also for multiple-exon
3UTRs, the longest (in number of base-pairs) is chosen.
