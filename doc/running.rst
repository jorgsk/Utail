Running Utail
=============
Go to the directory where the Utail scripts are saved and run::

    $ python Utail.py

Depending on the size of your dataset this takes from 10 minutes to 1-2 hours.
When the script has finished running, the output is found in the folder
``output`` as two files: ``length_dset1`` and ``polya_dset``. See section XXX
for a description of the output parameters.
