0) Motivation for studying 3UTRs in general
i) Involved in regulation of transcript localization and degradation, among
other thorugh snRNA binding sites.

The 3' untranslated region (3UTR) of mRNAs is generally involved in the
regulation of mRNA transport and degradation. A gene can produce transcripts
with multiple 3UTR isoforms, chiefly through the usage of different
polyadenylation sites. By varying the nucleotide composition of a 3UTR through
alternative polyadenylation, cis-regulatory elements can be retained or
discarded. For example, snRNAs frequently bind 3UTRs, acting as repressors of
translation, which is the implied reason why proliferating and cancer cell
lines exhibit shortened 3UTR tails (cite people). Also, binding sites in the
3UTR are partially responsible for the degradation of mis-translated mRNAs
(lykke dansk).

1) Motivation for studying polyadenylation
ii) The tell-tale sign of the end of an mRNA's 3UTR, and a signal for ending
transcription

Evidence from ESTs and cDNA shows that At least half of human genes contain two
or more polyadenylation sites in their 3UTRs (tiaaan), indicating that
regulation of 3UTR length may be common in the cell. Around 70% of
polyadenylation sites are contain a cis-hexamer around 20 nt downstram, called
the polyadenylation signal (PAS). Other cis-regulator regions have been
implied, but to a lesser extent (CITE). Polyadenylation happes by a two step
process, where the nascent transcript is first cleaved at the polyadenylation
site and subsequently polyadenylated by poly(A) polymerase. In humans, the
length of the poly(A) tail normally reaches around 250 nucleotides.  However,
there are also non-canonical polyadenylation mechanisms (cite noncanonical 3'
end processing Spector). Regardless of mechanism or PAS site existence, the
tell-tale sign of the polyA site is the poly(A) tail, which consist almost
exclusively of adenosie nucleotides.

iii) The map of polyadenylation sites in a 3UTR gives a map over possible 3UTR
isoforms.

An important reason to annotate polyadenylation sites is that they give
information about the possible 3UTR isoforms that can be transcribed from a
gene. As more is being learned about snRNA regulation in the 3UTRs, the
precise knowledge of the polyadenylation patterns for a given transcript will
become more valuable.

2) Motivation for stydying polyadenylation in RNA-seq
i)RNA-seq aims to quantify the transcriptome and identify novel transcripts

RNA-seq aims to quantify the transcriptome and identify novel transcripts and
transcript isoforms (CITE review).

ii) isoform detection is difficult, but poly(A) sites are the hallmark of the
end of an isoform, and aid in gene identification.

Quantification of different isoforms is difficult because the reads of
different mRNA isoforms will map to the same genomic region where the isoforms
overlap in sequence. While different 3UTR isoforms indeed overlap each other,
they leave a hallmark behind: the poly(A) tail. Since the poly(A) tail is part
of the transcriptome, it is possible to identify reads that cover the
poladenylation site by trimming poly(A) tails of unmapped reads and remapping
them to the genome. If a read remaps after the poly(A)-trimming, there is a
good chance that this read originated from a piece of the original transcript
that covered the polyadenylation site, in which case we will refer to it as a
poly(A) read.

By doing this to all the unmapped read of an RNA-seq experiment, one can hope
to obtain a map of all the polyadenylation events in the transcriptome under
investigation. Further, by counting the number of poly(A) reads that cluster
around each poly(A) site, one obtains a measure of the relative usage of each
3UTR isomer that ended at that poly(A) site. Then, by comparing the
polyadenylation maps between experiments, one can infer the relative usage of
different 3UTR isomers between the different experiments.

In reality, common RNA-seq protocols are negatively biased toward the 5' and 3'
ends, meaning that read coverage decreases toward the 5' and 3' ends. Thus, for
lowly expressed transcripts or 3UTR isoforms, it is possible that no poly(A)
reads are obtained. Special RNA-seq protocols have been developed to circumvent
this problem (CITE HERE AND THERE). While these experiments will capture many
more polyadenylation events than experiments that use standard protocols, there
is also a loss of information. Here we show that even with a 3UTR-non-specific
rna-seq protocol we manage to capture a large amount of the polyadenylation
activity in transcriptomes, sufficient for making meaningful comparison between
the polyadenlyation patterns of different 3UTRs

1) Capacity to discover poly(A) sites with current standard RNA-seq techniques
FIGURE

The capacity of current all-round RNA-seq protocol for discovering
polyadenylation sites can be seen in Figure 1. As can be seen, the total number
of polyadenylation sites level off at 2X thousand sites. A polyadenylation site
is counted if it has 2 or more supporting poly(A) reads or if it is landing at
an annotated polyadenylation site. Increasing the number of reads do not add
more polyadenylation sites. With an estimated XXX actively transcribed mRNA
transcript, one expects at least XXXX polyadenlyation sites that could
potentialyl be discovred. Because the rate of discovery is XX% for high RPKM
transcripts and only $$% for low RPKM transcripts, it is coverage that sents
the limit for polyadenylation discovery. But only up to a certain point; after
this point adding more read, and thereby more coverage, does not add to the
number of polyadenylation clusters identified. T

More importantly: the number of annotated 3UTRs: how many unique genes are
covered by those regions? how many transripts? this would truly give us a good
number to work from.
NOTE: write as much as you like: then synthesize it down to a paragraph or two.

2) Two annotation sources: poly(A)DB and GENCODE.
FIGURE

In Figure 2 is desplayed the intersection between the polyaddnylation sites for
the GENCODE datasets with two sources of annotated polyadenylation sites for
human. As can be seen, ... 

3) Briefly about the method
i) NR of sites found with >1 site, % of which are annotated, % of which have
PAS, good PAS etc. Make this into a table and put at the end. The high
percentage of 1-cover sites that are annotated point to that the limitation
lies in the coverage and read length. As these things improve, we will we might
reach the total number of 3UTRs covered.

pipeline.


5) Coverage might not be enough, since some 3UTRs express themselves
independently of the host mRNA. Thus the best information that can be had about
the relative usage of 3UTR isoforms comes from the poly(A) pattern.

#NOTE: you have a clear lack in your method. It's not only 3UTRs that are
polyadenylated. Also long noncoding RNAs are.

# You need this number: for each 3UTR and each gene, how many polyadenylation
# events do you find? This number can challenge Tian's number. And it shows
# that 3UTR isoform regulation is abundant.

# NOTE: you find a comparable number of new poly(A) sites in the 3UTR, 15000.
# The rest is novel stuff for them! They've lots in intergenic regions. HEY!
# you don't know: maybe the TIANDB and USCS numbers are 3UTR ones. Probably
# yes. Opps.

# NOTE why don't you make a simple plot like they did? It's short, and it
# captures the relevnant information.

# NOTE!!!!!!!!!!! NOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT POLY(A) SITE IS ENTIRELY STRAND
# SPECIFIC, YOU HADN'T NEEDED TO EXCLUDE OVERLAPPING 3UTRs FOR POLYA STUDY. YOU
# STILL NEED TO EXCLUDE THEM FOR A 3UTR lenght STUDY.
