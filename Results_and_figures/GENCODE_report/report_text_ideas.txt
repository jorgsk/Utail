Focus points of the report:

1) Capacity to discover poly(A) sites with current standard RNA-seq techniques
FIGURE

*) Why are poly(A) sites important? 
1) For a given transcript, it gives information about usage of alternative 3UTR
isoforms, or even protein coding isoforms, if the poly(A) site is before the
3UTR. This it can work as an exon exclusion mechanism as well. (not really,
splicing is actually the core mechnism for this regulation -- but the poly(A)
reads let us spie this!)
2) This in turn gives information about 3UTR regulation, important for many
things. Short 3UTR more highly expressed, at least partially due to reduced
capacity of snRNAs to repress expression through 3UTR binding.
3) Coverage might not be enough, since some 3UTRs express themselves
independently of the host mRNA. Thus the best information that can be had about
the relative usage of 3UTR isoforms comes from the poly(A) pattern.
4) argument against specialist RNA-seq protocols: you want all in one package,
no?

NOTE: write as much as you like: then synthesize it down to a paragraph or two.

2) Overlap with annotated poly(A) sites
3) Two annotation sources: poly(A)DB and GENCODE.
FIGURE

3) Briefly about the method
i) NR of sites found with >1 site, % of which are annotated, % of which have
PAS, good PAS etc. Make this into a table and put at the end. The high
percentage of 1-cover sites that are annotated point to that the limitation
lies in the coverage and read length. As these things improve, we will we might
reach the total number of 3UTRs covered.

#NOTE: you have a clear lack in your method. It's not only 3UTRs that are
polyadenylated. Also long noncoding RNAs are.

# You need this number: for each 3UTR, how many polyadenylation events do you
# find?

# NOTE!!!!!!!!!!! NOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT POLY(A) SITE IS ENTIRELY STRAND
# SPECIFIC, YOU HADN'T NEEDED TO EXCLUDE OVERLAPPING 3UTRs FOR POLYA STUDY. YOU
# STILL NEED TO EXCLUDE THEM FOR A 3UTR lenght STUDY.
