Data from summary of if they have annotatd sites and such:

NOTE!! THIS CANNOT BE TRUSTED FOR AAAA, BECAUSE FOR THESE RUNS YOU SHOULD MAP FROM "THIS STRAND" not from "OTHER STRAND" :)
IF YOU RUN THIS AGAIN, TRYIGN TO MAP ONLY THOSE THAT MAP TO THE OTHER STRAND (4 runs -- 2 more) YOU HAVE A BETTER OVERVIEW.

AND FURTHER NOTE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME UNDISCOVERED POLYAS OVERLAPPING THOSE YOU ALREADY HAVE :)

NOTE: THE PROGRAM MUST BE ABLE TO KNOW IF A READ IS POLYA OR POLYT AND MUST BE ABLE TO SEE WHICH STRAND IT BELONGS TO
POLY(A) READS MAP TO THE SAME STRAND AS THE TRANSCRIPT. POLY(T) READS MAP TO THE OPPOSITE STRAND. ALSO
