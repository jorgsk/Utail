I am a little confused about this.

In fig 6, the DNA is attached to flow-cell by both red and purple adapters in
the same cluster. However, in fig 7, it is attached only by red adapters.

What causes it to happen?

Both adapters would mean the DNA strands in clusters are not identical, but
half of them are complimentary to the other half.  For paired-end sequencing,
after having reached the desired cycle-count the synthesized strand is removed,
another step of bridge amplification is carried out, followed by a cleaving of
sequences bound with adapter1 to the cell surface. Thus leaving the
`other'/reverse strand bound to the flow cell for sequencing...


I need to make a picture to show that the poly(A) reads come from the reverse
strand. This picture should put me in a good position to select which end of
the poly(A) read I think the actual poly(A) tail is at.
