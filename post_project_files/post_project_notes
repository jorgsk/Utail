So. Julien's comrades want to get the poly(A) sites in a different fashion.

What do they want?

You currently have an output file. They want this file, but modified to suit
the consortium... :S sounds scary. Anyway, they want the following:

1) Normalized, tags per million (TPM) reads mapped, instead of / in addition to
the raw number of supporting reads

2) The 4th column must use different terminology. Use experiment IDs (see
labExpid attribute in
/users/rg/jlagarde/projects/encode/scaling/whole_genome/dcc_submission/samples/all_Mouse+Human_samples.tsv
instead of metadata concatenation)

3) Explicitly list all the experiments which have been considered in the 4th
field for all cell-lines, like Sarah has done. The best would be a key-value
pair labExpId:TPM

4) Do this for all 200 RNAseq as well as 34 in mouse.


You are grepping out type=bam, dataType=RnaSeq, and LongPolyA for the dashboard
file to get what you want.


One question for Julien: what is the view=Alignments/Splices/Spikeins tag for?
Should I only use the alignments?
