* Gencodev10_CAGE_TSS_clusters_May2012.gff is a gff version2 file.
  It contains TSS clusters obtained from two different sources of information:
  - Gencode v10 TSS (ftp://genome.crg.es/pub/Encode/data_analysis/TSS/Gencodev10_TSS_May2012.gff.gz) =  most 5' bp of Gencode v10 transcripts
  - PolyA+ Whole cell TSS CAGE clusters (Timo Lassmann at Riken, Jan11 + Mar12 freezes) filtered for IDR (0.1) and for HMM TSS prediction strength (0.5)
  
* The 148,434 (not low confidence) Gencode v10 TSS (present here ftp://genome.crg.es/pub/Encode/data_analysis/TSS/Gencodev10_TSS_May2012.gff.gz)
  were first extented by 50 bp on 5' and on 3' and strandedly merged into 103,956 Gencode TSS clusters.
  Timo's whole cell polyA+ CAGE clusters filtered for IDR (0.1) and for HMM TSS prediction strength (0.5) were strandedly merged into 72,186 CAGE clusters.
  These two types of TSS clusters were then strandedly merged into 151,219 Gencode CAGE clusters of which:
  - 80,118 are GencOnly
  - 48,832 are CAGEOnly
  - 22,269 are GencCAGE
  and were then quantified using the individual CAGE cluster within each cell line (mean tpm).

* More details are provided at ftp://genome.crg.es/pub/Encode/data_analysis/TSS/Gencodev10_CAGE_TSS_clusters_May2012.pdf

* In this gff file, each line represents a different Gencode CAGE TSS cluster and looks like this:
